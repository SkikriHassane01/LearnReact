# React Concepts

An introduction to React, covering the basics of components, state, props, and creating a simple React application to get familiar with the fundamentals.

- **Card Components**: Reusable UI elements that structure and display content like images, text, and actions, commonly used in dashboards, product listings, and user profiles.

- **Add CSS Styles**: The process of applying CSS to control the appearance of React components, enhancing the visual appeal of your application.

- **Props**: Read-only inputs passed to a component that allow for the dynamic rendering of data, enabling customization and reusability of components.

- **Conditional Rendering**: A technique to display different UI elements based on specific conditions, useful for showing loading spinners, error messages, or alternative layouts.

- **Render Lists**: Dynamically rendering a list of items using JavaScript's `map()` function, commonly used for displaying collections of data like user profiles or product items.

- **Click Events**: Handling user clicks in React components with the `onClick` event handler, which triggers actions like submitting forms or toggling UI elements.

- **useState() Hook**: A hook that adds state to functional components, allowing for the management of component-level state such as form inputs or counters.

- **onChange Event Handler**: An event handler used to capture and respond to changes in input fields, commonly used to update state based on user input.

- **Color Picker App**: A React application that lets users select and apply colors, often used for UI customization or theme previewing.

- **Updater Functions**: Functions provided by hooks like `useState()` to update the component's state in response to user actions or other events, ensuring the UI reflects the latest state.

- **Update Objects in State**: Modifying objects stored in state without mutating the original object, typically done by spreading the object to create a new one with updated properties.

- **Update Arrays in State**: Modifying arrays stored in state without mutating the original array, commonly done by spreading the array or using methods like `map()`.

- **Update Array of Objects in State**: Modifying arrays of objects in state without mutating the original array or objects, often achieved by creating new copies of the updated objects.

- **To-Do List App**: A React application where users can add, remove, and manage tasks in a list format, used to practice state management, list rendering, and event handling.

- **useEffect() Hook**: A hook that performs side effects in functional components, such as fetching data or setting up subscriptions, running code after rendering or when dependencies change.

- **Digital Clock App**: A React application that displays the current time and updates every second, used to practice managing intervals and state in time-based effects.

- **useContext() Hook**: A hook that allows sharing state across components without prop drilling by accessing the context API, useful for managing global state like themes or user authentication.

- **useRef() Hook**: A hook that provides a way to directly access and manipulate DOM elements or persist values across renders without causing re-renders, commonly used for managing focus or storing references.
